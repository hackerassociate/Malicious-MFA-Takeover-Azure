# Malicious-MFA-Takeover-Azure
This PowerShell script is designed for malicious purposes to facilitate MFA account takeover. It identifies dormant accounts, and if MFA is not configured, the attacker can initiate an MFA handshake. Once the handshake is completed, they can gain direct access using an authenticator app.
